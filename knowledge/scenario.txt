This is proposed work flow:

There are several re-spawn points where bot cars appeared.
All these points located on some map board borders.
First 3 seconds our main car is waiting, this time bot cars appeared
and moved to their destination. This delay is required to create real traffic
before main car starts.

Main car knows own destination point, calculates the shortest path
and move according to it. For now no changes in route according to real road traffic.

There is predefined destination point for all cars in re-spawn point.
It means all of them move on the same route.


Cars:
There are 2 types of cars: car and truck.
Car has less length, width, but more maximum velocity and time headway.
Trucks have more length, width, but less maximum velocity and time headway.


Goal:
The very first prototype must contain two cars: main and companion
and they must interact in appropriate way. It means move according to
programmed model.
